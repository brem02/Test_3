# Custom Log File

I am unable to send the custom selenium log file to Azure Log Workspace

## Steps taken

- Ensure agent is installed on machine
- Allow internet outbound rules
- Set read access to log directory
- No log rotation, append log data to log file
- Confirmed, VM heartbeat and syslogs are going to the workspace
